Hi there! I'm Morgan, a data expert. I've spent lots of time learning about data stuff for 5 years, and I've been working in the field for 3 years now. I know a bunch about looking at data and using computer programs to help with it.

I'm really good at making data easy to understand, even for folks who aren't experts. I'm careful about getting all the details right, and I always try to do the best job I can. I'm excited to learn even more and help solve problems using data. If you've got any questions or want to chat about working together, just give me a shout. Thanks!
